This project involved a fluid mechanics–focused dissection of an inkjet printer to identify and analyze the components most relevant to fluid flow. Our team determined that the ink cartridges were the most fluid-mechanics-driven part of the system due to their reliance on capillary action. My contribution focused on researching capillary action and how it governs ink movement within the cartridge, as well as writing the script for our final project video, which explained both the physical dissection and the fluid mechanics analysis.
